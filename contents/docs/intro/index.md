Introduction
============

o42a is not inspired by any particular programming language and is rather
designed from scratch. The ideas behind it are not something completely new, but
their combination is unique. The language syntax tries to be close to the
written text with sentences and punctuation meanings intended to be intuitive to
the reader. This syntax is unique too.

You can familiarize yourself with the language by reading about
[language features](features.html) and see the
["Hello, World!" program explanation](hello_world_explained.html).
Other material will be added later.
