o42a-0.2.4 Release Notes
========================

This is primarily a bugfix release. Just a few actual changes was made to the
core library, but this revealed a lot of bugs and some design issues.


Link Dereferencing Rules
-------------------------

The automatic link dereferencing rules was improved to better work for phrases.
A phrase never dereferenced automatically before. Now, any phrase resulting to a
link will be automatically dereferenced, unless it's prefix contains a link body
reference. This is purely syntactic rule, so it is always clear whether a phrase
will be automatically dereferenced or not.


Indexed Prototype
-----------------

Both `Row` and `Array` core objects derived from `Indexed` prototype now. This
prototype declares an interface for work with indexed items. It uses macros and
is applicable to any type of items.

Array and row items access is implemented using ordinary fields and phrases now
instead of special technique used before.
