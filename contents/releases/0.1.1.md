o42a-0.1.1 Release Notes
========================

This is a maintenance release of o42a. It seriously improves the compiler
performance and provides the support for arbitrary source file encodings.


Improvements
------------

### Compiler Memory Consumption Decreased ###

The `o42ac` in release 0.1.0 was able to compile the test suite with
`--vmargs -Xmx576m` (which means the maximum memory allocation pool set to 576
megabytes) and was unable to compile it with lesser memory limit.

Now, the same suite can be compiled with `--vmargs -Xmx160m`, which means that
**compiler consumes over 70% less memory**.


### Compiler Performance Increased ###

The test suite compilation time decreased from 8.5 seconds in 0.1.0 to 4.9
seconds in 0.1.1 on my overclocked Core i7, which means that
**compiler works more than 40% faster**.


New Features
------------

New `o42ac` options:

* `-encoding`, `-E` - source files encoding (UTF-8 by default);
* `-F` - a shorthand for `-format` option.

Bug Fixes
---------

Proper support for supplementary code points in source files.
