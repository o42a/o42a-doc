o42a-0.1.6 Release Notes
========================

Getters
-------

A getter is a stateless link which target is re-evaluated on each request. This
allows, for example, to define a string adapter for a mutable object. When the
state of such object changes, a string representation changes accordingly.

Another important feature of getters is an assignment statement customization.
This makes getters able to act as properties.


Adapters
--------

An adapter can no longer be declared as prototype. Instead, adapter can be
declared as getter, which may serve the same purpose.


Phrases
-------

A new intrinsic reference `$Prefix$` can be used inside of a clause content.
A prefix of the phrase will be substituted instead of this intrinsic when the
corresponding clause triggers.


Core Library
------------

A string adapters were added to the numeric objects. Also, an `Integer` can be
converted to `Float` with appropriate adapter.
