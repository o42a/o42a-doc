o42a-0.2.0 Release Notes
========================

This is a milestone release. The development enters a prototyping stage now (it
was a draft before this point).

All documented language features are implemented. More features will be added
later.

The implementation is far from stability and the core libraries are still almost
absent. This will be addressed during 0.2.x development cycle and the next major
release (0.3.0) should be practically usable.


Reference Syntax
----------------

The field reference syntax improved to support the parentheses around ascendant
reference. So, it is possible to write a compound references now like this:
```
foo: bar @(type owner: bar owner): baz @baz owner
```

The same enhancement made for the adapter reference. So, the following code:
```
foo @@(type: adapter): adapter field
```
means the same as
```
foo: adapter field @type: adapter
```
