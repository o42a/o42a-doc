o42a-0.2.1 Release Notes
========================

This release introduces a macro support.

The macro is an object, which value is an arbitrary expression. This expression
can be substituted to the program with a macro expansion unary operator:
```
#Expression resolved to a macro
```

The macro field can be declared as any other one, but a shorter syntax is also
supported:
```
#Macro field := expression
```

When a macro field is overridden, it is re-expanded in the derived object thus
rewriting the dependent definitions. This can be used to create generics for
example:
```
Generic :=> void (
  #Type :=< void // Type parameter 
  Link :=< (`#type) void
)
Integer generic := generic (
  Type = integer // Override the type parameter
  Link = 123     // Integer will be substituted as a new link interface.
)
```

As for now, the macro expansion can only be used as a type parameter. But this
limitation will be removed over time to support the macro expansion in (almost?)
all places, where arbitrary expressions can be used.
