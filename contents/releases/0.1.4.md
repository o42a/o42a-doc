o42a-0.1.4 Release Notes
========================

Code Generation Improvements
----------------------------

The constant back-end optimizes executable code now. It records, optimizes, and
then emits to LLVM the exported functions and globals. The globals and other
functions used by them are also emitted. This prevents the unused functions and
globals from appearing in executable. In contrast, LLVM may emit unused
functions or globals, because it has insufficient information.

Also, the compiler runs a bit (~6%) faster now. Probably because the compiler
issues less JNI calls and emits less data to LLVM.


IR Improvements
---------------

An internal (run-time) representation of objects were slightly reworked and
reduced.
