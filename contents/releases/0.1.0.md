o42a-0.1.0 Release Notes
========================

This is an initial release of o42a programming language. It is intended for
introduction of the main language concepts and is a result of two and a half
years of development.

This is a draft implementation. It's still missing many of the important
language features and has a very basic runtime library. But this is enough to
start writing simplest programs to getting familiar with o42a.

The only supported platform is __GNUL/Linux x86_64__.

Known Issues
------------

* Garbage collector not implemented yet.
* Intrinsic and ascendant references not implemented.
* Conditional field declarations not implemented.
* Intermediate expression results not cached, which may cause the code intended
  for the one-time execution to be executed multiple times.
* Test coverage is weak. This especially affects an imperative code.
* Normalization (executable code redundancy elimination) is not good enough.
  Generated executables are too big and compilation of a big enough programs is
  too slow.
