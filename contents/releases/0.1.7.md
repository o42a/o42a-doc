o42a-0.1.7 Release Notes
========================

Sentences And Value Definition
------------------------------

Declarative sentences are treated the same way as imperative ones. The value
definition consists of claims and propositions, which are evaluated in  order.
The derived claims always evaluated before the explicit claims and propositions.
The derived propositions are executed automatically if the value is not
overridden.

The sentences can be separated with colons and semicolons only. The opposite
separator (vertical line) is gone, replaced by a semicolon.


Logical Values
--------------

With a new sentence semantics, the "unknown" logical value is no longer
produced. The logical values can only be "true" or "false". The logic is
Boolean now.

So, the known (`+-`) and unknown (`-+`) unary logical operators are no longer
needed and were removed.


References
----------

The ascendant reference (`^<ascendant>^`) is no longer supported.

Due to the value definition changes, the following intrinsic references support
were removed:

* `$value$`
* `$condition$`
* `$requirement$`
* `$claim$`
* `$proposition$`

So, the intrinsic references are used only inside clauses now.
