o42a-0.2.8 Release Notes
========================

Stateful Objects
----------------

Objects are stateful by default. This means that object value is evaluated on
each request. The exceptions are variables and arrays.

Now, any object can be made stateful. For that a _keep value_ (`\\`) operator
can be used. The value of stateful object is evaluated at most once. The
evaluated value is cached inside the object and returned on subsequent value
requests.

The object statefulness is inherited. So, any object derived from the stateful
object is stateful too.


Assignment Statements
---------------------

A _binding_ statement (`<-`) is used now to assign new values to variables or
for custom assignments. It does exactly what former _variable assignment_ (`=`)
statement did before.

The equal sign is used for _value assignment_ statement now, which is an
enhanced version of assignment. It does the following:

- makes the value object stateful (just like a _keep value_ operator),
- evaluates its value, and
- assigns it to the target (just like a _binding_ statement).

This makes the assignment to behave more traditionally for imperative
programming languages.

The _combined assignment_ statements (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`) known from C have
been added to o42a to reduce the boilerplate. Now, a loop can be written like
this:
```
``0 $ i {
  I += 1
  Print [i] '/10' nl ~~ `1/10` ... `10/10`
  I < 10?...
}
```
