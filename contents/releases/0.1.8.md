o42a-0.1.8 Release Notes
========================

Garbage Collector
-----------------

This release contains a simple concurrent mark-and-sweep garbage collector.

The garbage collection thread is always running if there is a data to process.
The delays however are minimal and may be caused only by concurrent locks when
submitting a data block to garbage collector. Such a locks are extremely
short-lived and can't noticeably slow down the application.


Thread Safety
-------------

The internal representation (IR) of objects is thread safe now.

Each object has a mutex and condition. They are used to prevent races while
initializing fields or evaluating object values. Only one thread at a time can
perform one of such operations on the same object, the others will wait for the
operation to complete and then will reuse it's result.


Dependency Upgrade
------------------

LLVM version 3.1 is required now.
