release: 0.2.3

This is a significant change in language semantics. Object values are stateless
by default, which means they are not preserved, but evaluated on each request.
This makes objects act like functions. To preserve the once evaluated value, a
new 'keep value' operator can be used.

The language runtime license has been changed to the LGPLv3.
