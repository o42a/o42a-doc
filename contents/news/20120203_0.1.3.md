release: 0.1.3

This release introduces a new compilation stage called _normalization_. This
stage is responsible for generated code redundancy elimination and includes
different techniques based on a static code analysis.

The compiler is now able to "inline" objects in many, quite common, situations,
converting object data structures and functions to executable code fragments.
This drastically reduces the size of generated executables.
