Release 0.2.6
=============

An imperative and declarative code are almost fully unified. The difference
between them is that the declarative blocks may contain member declarations,
while the imperative blocks can loop.

Locals can be declared anywhere now. A new syntax allows to declare the local
along with its scope.

Phrases may contain intervals now.

Some scope references, unary operators syntax, and line continuation rules have
been changed.
