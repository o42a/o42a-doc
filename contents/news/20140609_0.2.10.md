This is a significant change to the language. A lot of features were simplified,
replaced, or just removed. Several new important features were added also.

The multiple inheritance support have been dropped. The object value definition
algorithm have been significantly simplified. The object statefulness
functionality have been replaced by eager value evaluation. Changes have been
made to the syntax of sentences, local declarations, and value assignment
to avoid any possible conflicts.

New features: static fields, aliases, yield statement, short adapter declaration
syntax, short field override syntax.

Some rarely used and confusing features were removed.
