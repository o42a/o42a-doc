Type parameters can be declared for any object now.

Two new operators support have been added, a _compare_ operator (**`<=>`**)
suitable to perform a generic comparison and a _suffix_ one (`~`) capable of
representing things such as quantities.

Hexadecimal, binary, and floating point literals syntax support has been added.
Other syntax improvements have been made.

A lot of bugs were fixed.

The language runtime license has been changed to the MPL-2.0.
