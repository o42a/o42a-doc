Stateful objects can be constructed now with a _keep value_ (`\\`) operator.
The value of stateful object is evaluated at most once in contrast to standard
stateless object, which value is evaluated on each request.

The binding statement (`<-`) is used now to assign new values to variables. In
addition, a value assignment statement (`=`) can be used to perform the
assignments in a more traditional imperative manner.

The combined assignment statements (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`) have been added.
